# MachineLearningAlgos
A python implementation of basic machine Learning algorithms

Following machine learning algorithms are implemented :

k-Nearest Neighbour


CART 

Decision Trees

kMeans

Support Vector Machine(John C. Platt's sMO )

Naive Bayes based email classifier(very naive :D)

Adaboost & pca are still in process....

<i>Reimplemented by learning from MLIA , Peter Harrington</i>
